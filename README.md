# quantify_RNAscope_OD_signals
The cell_binning_by_OD.py bins the cells into 4 categories by their average optical densities. 
The obj_to_annotation.py converts the obj file to annotation files. The annotation file can be imported to HALO to visualize the cells with differnt average optical densities.
